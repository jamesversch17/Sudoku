To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.

To test, run `make test`.

To run executable in the top level directory (the one this read me is in), run `./sudoku`.

To run GUI, after make, use python3 (or python if not on mac) graphics.py.

Furthur documentation and README.md's are in subdirectories and DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, and TESTING.md in this directory
